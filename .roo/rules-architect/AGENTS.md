# Project Architecture Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- This is a configuration repository, not a traditional software project
- Architecture consists of command definitions in markdown format
- Commands follow a consistent pattern: YAML frontmatter + structured markdown
- No build system, dependencies, or traditional architectural layers
- The entire system is defined by markdown files in the `commands/` directory
- No traditional architectural patterns apply (MVC, microservices, etc.)
