# Project Debug Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- No traditional debugging required - this is a configuration repository
- Commands are defined as static markdown files with no executable code
- No build system, package manager, or runtime environment to debug
- Issues would be in command structure or formatting, not code execution
- Validation would involve checking YAML frontmatter and markdown structure
