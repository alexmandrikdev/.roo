# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- This repository contains Roo Code's global settings and command definitions
- Commands are defined as markdown files in `commands/` directory using YAML frontmatter
- The `description` field in frontmatter is used for command metadata
- Commands follow structured markdown format with numbered lists for instructions
- No traditional documentation exists - command files are the primary documentation
- This is a configuration repository, not a code project with typical documentation
