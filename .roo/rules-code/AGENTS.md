# Project Coding Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Commands are defined as markdown files in `commands/` directory with YAML frontmatter
- Command files use structured markdown with numbered lists for instructions
- File naming convention: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `clarify.md`)
- This is a configuration-only repository - no traditional code development occurs here
- All command definitions follow the same pattern: frontmatter with description, then structured markdown content
