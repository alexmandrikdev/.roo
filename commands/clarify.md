description: "Instructs Roo to proactively identify and clarify any ambiguous or unclear aspects of the task before proceeding with implementation."

When you encounter any ambiguity, lack of clarity, or missing information in the task description, please pause and seek clarification before proceeding. Specifically:

1. **Identify unclear requirements** - Point out any aspects of the task that are ambiguous, incomplete, or open to interpretation
2. **Highlight missing context** - Note any essential information that's not provided (technical constraints, design preferences, performance requirements, etc.)
3. **Ask targeted questions** - Formulate specific, actionable questions to resolve the ambiguity
4. **Provide context for clarification** - Explain why the clarification is needed and how it will impact the solution
5. **Offer multiple-choice options** - When possible, suggest 2-4 specific alternatives to help guide the conversation

Use this approach when:

- Requirements are vague or incomplete
- Technical constraints aren't specified
- Design preferences aren't clear
- Edge cases aren't addressed
- Success criteria are ambiguous
