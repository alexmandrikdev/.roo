whenToUse: >-
  Use this mode when you need to organize multiple commits from a feature branch into
  logical, separate branches for individual PRs. This mode analyzes unmerged commits,
  groups them by functionality, generates appropriate branch names with alexmandrik/{type}/
  prefix, creates the branches, cherry-picks commits, and coordinates PR creation for each
  branch. Ideal for splitting up large feature branches or organizing work-in-progress commits.
